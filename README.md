# decay2phasespace
Make [decaylanguage](https://github.com/scikit-hep/decaylanguage) and [phasespace](https://github.com/zfit/phasespace) work together.
Also uses [particle](https://github.com/scikit-hep/particle) and [zfit](https://github.com/zfit/zfit) (and pytest for tests).

Currently in development stage. Anything can change at any time, including the repository name.

See [this issue](https://github.com/scikit-hep/decaylanguage/issues/86) on decaylanguage for the motivation behind this project.
